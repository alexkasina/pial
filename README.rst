pial - Python Imaging Abstraction Library
=========================================

An overview
===========

pial is a re-packaging and adaption of sorl-thumbnails image manipulation
internals. The idea is to make the flexibility of sorl's engines available
to other projects in a simple, compact form.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.6+
* PIL or pgMagick or conver

Credit where it's due
=====================

Most of the hard work in putting this project together was done by the authors
of sorl-thumbnails. We just pulled it from their repo, dusted it off, and
re-packaged it as a separate project.
